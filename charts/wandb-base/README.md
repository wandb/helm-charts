# Weights & Biases Base Helm Chart

This chart provides a base template for creating Weights & Biases Kubernetes resources. It serves as a foundation for other W&B charts and can be used to deploy custom W&B components.

## Overview

The wandb-base chart provides a flexible framework for deploying various Kubernetes resources including:

- Deployments
- StatefulSets
- Jobs
- CronJobs
- Services
- Ingress

The chart is designed to be highly configurable while providing sensible defaults. It supports a wide range of Kubernetes features including pod security contexts, resource management, autoscaling, and more.

## Configuration Precedence

One of the key features of this chart is its hierarchical configuration system. Many values can be set at multiple levels, with a clear precedence order. Understanding this precedence is crucial for effective configuration.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be defined at multiple levels, with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Container-specific environment variables (`containers.<container-name>.env`)
2. Sizing-based environment variables (`sizing.<size>.env`)
3. Chart-level environment variables (`env`)
4. Legacy environment variables (`extraEnv`)
5. Global environment variables (`global.env`)
6. Legacy global environment variables (`global.extraEnv`)

Example:

```yaml
# Global environment variables (lowest precedence)
global:
  env:
    LOG_LEVEL: "info"

# Chart-level environment variables
env:
  LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
  MAX_CONNECTIONS: "100"

# Container-specific environment variables (highest precedence)
containers:
  app:
    env:
      LOG_LEVEL: "trace"
```

In this example, the `LOG_LEVEL` for the `app` container would be set to `trace`.

Additionally, environment variables can be sourced from ConfigMaps and Secrets using the `envFrom` field:

```yaml
envFrom:
  app-config: "configMapRef"
  app-secrets: "secretRef"
```

### Pod Resources

Resource requests and limits can be defined at multiple levels, with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Container-specific resources (`containers.<container-name>.resources`)
2. Sizing-based resources (`sizing.<size>.resources`)
3. Chart-level resources (`resources`)

Important notes about resource configuration:

- The configurations are merged, so the actual resulting configuration can be a combination of values set at different levels. For example, if container-specific configuration defines CPU requests but not memory limits, the memory limits might be inherited from sizing-based or chart-level resources.
- In multi-container pods, if no container-level resources are set, all containers in the pod will get the same resource requests and limits (inherited from sizing or chart-level). This is likely not what you want, as different containers often have different resource needs. Always specify container-specific resources for multi-container pods.

Example:

```yaml
# Chart-level resources (lowest precedence)
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi

# Sizing-based resources
sizing:
  production:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 1Gi

# Container-specific resources (highest precedence)
containers:
  app:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 750m
        memory: 768Mi
      # Note: no limits defined at container level
```

In this example, if `size: "production"` is set and we have a partial container-specific configuration, the resulting merged configuration would be:

```yaml
# Resulting merged configuration for the 'app' container
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 750m        # From container-specific (highest precedence)
    memory: 768Mi    # From container-specific (highest precedence)
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m       # Inherited from sizing-based resources
    memory: 1Gi      # Inherited from sizing-based resources
```

### Security Contexts

Security contexts can be defined at multiple levels:

1. **Pod Security Context**: Applied to all containers in the pod
   - Defined in `podSecurityContext`

2. **Container Security Context**: Applied to specific containers
   - Container-specific: `containers.<container-name>.securityContext` (highest precedence)
   - Default container security context: `securityContext` (lowest precedence)

Example:

```yaml
# Pod-level security context (applies to all containers)
podSecurityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 999
  fsGroup: 0

# Default container security context
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true

# Container-specific security context
containers:
  app:
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
```

In this example:
- All containers will run as user 999 (from pod security context)
- The `app` container will have `readOnlyRootFilesystem: false` (overriding the default)
- All other containers will have `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` (from default security context)

### Container Images

Container images can be defined at multiple levels, with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Container-specific image configuration (`containers.<container-name>.image`)
2. Chart-level image configuration (`image`)

The image configuration at each level includes:
- `repository`: The image repository
- `tag`: The image tag
- `pullPolicy`: The image pull policy

When a container doesn't specify its own image configuration, it inherits the chart-level image configuration. This allows you to set a default image for all containers while still being able to override it for specific containers.

Example:

```yaml
# Chart-level image configuration (applies to all containers without specific image settings)
image:
  repository: nginx
  tag: "1.21.6"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# Container-specific image configurations
containers:
  app:
    # This container uses its own image configuration
    image:
      repository: myapp
      tag: "v1.0.0"
      pullPolicy: Always
  sidecar:
    # This container doesn't specify an image, so it will use the chart-level image
    env:
      SIDECAR_MODE: "true"
```

In this example:
- The `app` container will use the image `myapp:v1.0.0` with pull policy `Always`
- The `sidecar` container will use the chart-level image `nginx:1.21.6` with pull policy `IfNotPresent`

### Global Common Labels and Annotations

The chart supports a comprehensive labeling and annotation system with `global.common` values that apply to **ALL resources** (deployments, jobs, services, ingress, etc.). This provides a single place to configure labels and annotations for your entire application.

#### Configuration Levels (highest to lowest precedence):

1. **Resource-specific** (`deployment.labels`, `service.annotations`, etc.)
2. **Global resource-specific** (`global.deployment.labels`, `global.service.annotations`, etc.)  
3. **Local common** (`common.labels`, `common.annotations`)
4. **Global common** (`global.common.labels`, `global.common.annotations`)

#### Universal Labels and Annotations (Recommended)

Use `global.common` for labels/annotations that should apply to **everything**:

```yaml
# These labels/annotations will be applied to ALL resources
global:
  common:
    labels:
      environment: "production"
      team: "platform"
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "wandb"
    annotations:
      argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: "argocd"
      prometheus.io/scrape: "true"

# Local common labels for this specific chart instance
common:
  labels:
    chart-instance: "api-server"
  annotations:
    deployed-by: "helm"
```

#### Resource-Specific Overrides

For resource-specific customization:

```yaml
# Global settings for all deployments
global:
  deployment:
    labels:
      workload-type: "deployment"
    annotations:
      deployment.kubernetes.io/strategy: "rolling"

# Local deployment settings for this chart
deployment:
  labels:
    component: "api"
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision-policy: "manual"

# StatefulSet-specific settings
global:
  statefulset:
    labels:
      persistence: "enabled"
    annotations:
      statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-management-policy: "parallel"
```

#### Complete Example

```yaml
# Applied to ALL resources (deployments, jobs, services, ingress, etc.)
global:
  common:
    labels:
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "wandb-platform"
      environment: "production"
      managed-by: "platform-team"
    annotations:
      monitoring.example.com/scrape: "true"
      argocd.argoproj.io/instance: "wandb-prod"

# Applied to specific resource types
global:
  deployment:
    labels:
      workload-type: "deployment"
    annotations:
      deployment.kubernetes.io/managed-by: "argocd"

# Local chart overrides
deployment:
  labels:
    component: "api-server"
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/restart-policy: "always"
```

**Result**: Every resource gets the common labels/annotations, plus any resource-specific ones, with proper precedence handling.

### Container Configuration

Containers are defined in the `containers` section of the values file. Each container can have its own configuration:

```yaml
containers:
  app:
    image:
      repository: myapp
      tag: v1.0.0
    command: ["./start.sh"]
    args: ["--config", "/etc/config/config.yaml"]
    env:
      LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
        name: http
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
    volumeMounts:
      - name: config
        mountPath: /etc/config
```

### Service Configuration

| Parameter         | Description             | Default         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| `service.enabled` | Enable service creation | `true`          |
| `service.type`    | Service type            | `ClusterIP`     |
| `service.ports`   | Service ports           | See values.yaml |

### Autoscaling Configuration

The chart supports both Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA):

```yaml
autoscaling:
  horizontal:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 10
    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  vertical:
    enabled: true
    updateMode: "Auto"
    containerPolicies:
      - containerName: "*"
        controlledResources:
          - memory
          - cpu
```

### Sizing Configuration

The chart supports defining different "t-shirt" sizes for deployments, which can be used to configure resources, environment variables, and autoscaling for different environments:

```yaml
sizing:
  small:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
    env:
      MAX_CONNECTIONS: "100"
  medium:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
    env:
      MAX_CONNECTIONS: "500"
```

To use a specific size, set the `size` parameter:

```yaml
size: "medium"
```

## Examples

### Basic Deployment

```yaml
replicaCount: 2
image:
  repository: myapp
  tag: v1.0.0

containers:
  app:
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
        name: http
    env:
      LOG_LEVEL: "info"
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
```

### Deployment with Multiple Containers

```yaml
containers:
  app:
    image:
      repository: myapp
      tag: v1.0.0
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
        name: http
  sidecar:
    image:
      repository: sidecar
      tag: v1.0.0
    env:
      MAIN_APP_PORT: "8080"
```

### Job Configuration
